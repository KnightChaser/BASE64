# BASE64
Can I implement BASE64 in C++?

I implemented SHA256... then I also wanted to implement BASE64 too.

### Implementing. Not completed.

To-Do List (probably)
- [X] Encode (for ASCII range string)
- [ ] Decode (for ASCII range string)
- [ ] UTF-8 support
- [ ] Commandline
- [ ] Binary File support
